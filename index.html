             <p>In June of 2017, my wife and I took our family on a grand road trip. We set out to enjoy a long weekend of camping and music at the 44th annual "Telluride Bluegrass Festival".</p>

             <h2>The Drive</h2>
             <p>We left St. Louis filled with excitement. As we drove, my wife and I tried to prepare our children for the mountain experience ahead. Sunscreen, lip-balm, and constant hydration are key for survival.</p>

                <figcaption>Here we see a well played prank. Beneath a picnic table that sits opposite the above sign, a leopard print slipper slithers menacingly. This was enough to make a midwestern heart skip a beat! </figcaption>

             <h2>Camping</h2>
             <p>Because we had the coveted "Town Park" tickets, our camp site was located in the town of Telluride itself. We pitched our tent and made a camp on the shady bank of the San Miguel River. At an altitude of nearly 9,000 feet, the sun was intense during the day and the nights were quite cold.</p>
